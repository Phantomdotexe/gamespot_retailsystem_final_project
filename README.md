The GameSpot Retail System is a command-line application designed to simulate basic inventory management and customer shopping workflows for a retail video game store.

This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java, including class structure (Product, Customer, Order, Inventory), encapsulation (getters/setters), basic data management (using ArrayList), and console-based user interaction.
